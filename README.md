# 🧑‍💻 Caleb Ngeno
Software Developer | Cybersecurity Engineer | Systems & Finance Solutions Architect
I’m a multidisciplinary engineer with deep experience in web development, cybersecurity, system automation, and finance‑driven software solutions. Over the past four years on GitHub, I’ve built a reputation for writing secure, reliable, and maintainable code that solves real‑world problems with clarity and precision.
My work blends strong engineering fundamentals with practical problem‑solving — from building production‑ready Django applications to designing secure architectures and automating complex system workflows.

- Security: RBAC, encryption, secure API design, system auditing

# 🌍 Engineering Philosophy
I believe great software is:
- Secure by default
- Readable by anyone
- Predictable under pressure
- Designed for the future, not just today
I build systems that are not only functional, but robust, elegant, and resilient.
